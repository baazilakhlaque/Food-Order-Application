# Food Order Application
This is an application created using React.js and Google Firebase as the backend system. This application allows users to order food from a menu of choices. Users can browse different food ites, add those to a cart (or remove from the cart) and then proceed to the checkout form to submit an order after credentials are validated. Cart and user data are then sent to the backend.

This project enabled me to learn about React States and Context, building and configuring components, and managing HTTP requests and side effects. 

How to run:
- Install all the files
- Go into the project directory
- run npm install and npm start.
